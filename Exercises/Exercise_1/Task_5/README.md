# COM402 Homework 1 - Exercise 5: Stack Smashing  

The goal of this exercise is to gain hands-on experience with the effects of
buffer overflows and other memory-safety bugs. Your goal is to understand the
vulnerabilities in four target programs, and write an exploit for each target
program.

## VM Images

You will test your exploits within the virtual machine (VM) we provide that is
configured with Debian Lenny that has the address space layout randomization
(ASLR) turned off.

#### VirtualBox
+ [OVF](http://com402.epfl.ch/download/Boxes2.ovf)
+ [Disk](http://com402.epfl.ch/download/Boxes2-disk1.vmdk)

#### VMWare
+ [Image](http://com402.epfl.ch/download/vmware-boxes-2.1.tar.bz2)

## Tips for the VM Images

+ User account username/password: `user/user`
+ Root account username/password: `root/root`

#### Networking

It's most convenient to access the VM via SSH (copy-paste works better, and you can transfer files both way using the `scp` command). The images we provide use the Network Address Translation (NAT) networking mode by default.

To use SSH, you need to do the following steps:
 * Open the settings of your image
 * Go to the "Networking" panel
 * Choose "Advanced" and click on the "Port forwarding" button
 * Add a forwarding rule (green "plus" button on the side)
 * In the forwarding rule, leave IP addresses empty, set **Host IP** to _2222_, and **Guest IP** to 22 (the default SSH port)
 * Restart the virtual machine

Now, you can connect to your virtual machine via ssh:
`ssh -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1`

This is how you copy files _TO_ the VM:
`scp -P 2222 <path_to_copy_from_on_host_OS> user@127.0.0.1:<path_to_copy_to_on_guest_OS>`

Copy files _FROM_ the VM:
`scp -P 2222 user@127.0.0.1:<path_to_copy_from_on_guest_OS> <path_to_copy_to_on_host_OS> `
